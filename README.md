# CP2K data

The CP2K data repository provides a collection of databases and the tools to generate them for the CP2K code. 

Currently, these are mainly Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials.

Check [this README](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k-data/tree/master/potentials/Goedecker#readme) for further details.
